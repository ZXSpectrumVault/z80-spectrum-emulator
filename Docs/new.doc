              - TZX v1.12 file support.  Added switch -tz, modified switch
                -td.  (TZX=general tape file format, mainly by Tomaz Kac).
              - Added true VGA graphics mode; this mode works fine in
                Windows' DOS boxes, and solves problems for several laptop
                computers and incompatible video adapters.  This mode is
                default in DOS boxes (even full-screen ones).  Switch -g
                added (switch 'no sound' moved to -0g).
              - Changed speed code; ran into bounds on 200 MHz 80686.
                Switch -z changed slightly.  (Ian Lowndes)
              - Better Issue2/Issue3 emulation (Using info from Technical
                FAQ by Philip Kendall / Pera Putnik)
              - Better AY soundchip emulation, using square waves if
                possible.  (Thanks to Luca Bisti)  (Added switch -0o)
              - "ACB" stereo for AY sound implemented (suggested by Luca
                Bisti)  (Added switch -0w)
              - Removed snow in VGA modes (solution by Wim Oudshoorn)
          (*) - Disk drive is now reset to 720K DD when using Disciple/+D
                (Brian Cavers)
              - Pressing ENTER at empty line when saving snapshot pops
                up previous name (Suggested by Christopher Heys)
              - SLT level loading doesn't need extra memory anymore; used
                to fail sometimes when no EMS memory was present.
              - Included precise definition of R register field in Z80 file
                format definition.
              - Added information on XZX's and Warajevo's .Z80 format
                extensions (Philip Kendall)

                Lee Tonks)
              - Bugfix: Z80 now sets border colour when loading .SNA files
                (Philip Kendall)
              - Bugfix: Z80 didn't open or read from read-only .TAP files
                (Martin Jaros)
              - Bugfix: Deleting blocks from .TAP file now also works
                correctly if same file is used for both input and output.
                (Martin Jaros)
              - Bugfix: RS232 input redirection menu didn't work (Wojtek
                Wasilewski)
              - Bugfix: video routines slightly faster (Flashing
                attributes were refreshed too often).
              - Bugfix: Time is displayed correctly of long .VOC files (of
                about 10 minutes). (Martin Jaros)

                and Lee Tonks aka Blood told me about this)
              - RES/SET IX/IY could change ROM  (Red Scorpion; bug reported
                by Robert Zmyslowicz)
              - Z80 again works on all processors, including 8088/8086.
              - ALT-F7 shortcut to playing .TAP files works more
                intuitively, following suggestions by Einar Gattoni Saukas.
              - Added switches -tx and -tp, to suppress tape info window
                and to pause after each block respectively.  These setting
                can be changed at runtime.  (Suggestion by Blood)
              - Extended switch -d (double interrupt frequency) to allow
                both higher and lower interrupt frequencies than 50 Hz.

                General Protection Violation.  (Robert Zmyslowicz)
              - Bugfix: long OTIR to #FE in Hi Res Color mode crashed Z80
                (Confuzion; Bernhard Lutz)
              - Bugfix in OUT #FE routine when sound was turned off; caused
                Z80 to run very slowly sometimes  (Christopher Heys)
              - Floating bus emulation improved in HRC mode  (Ricochet; Lee
                Tonks noticed the problem)
              - Bug in filename-selection-by-typing-initials, introduced in
                v3.04, fixed.  (Bernhard Lutz, Einar Gattoni Saukas)
              - Z80 now runs under Windows 95 in DOS boxes. (v3.04 already
                did, in fact, but this list didn't say so)
              - Bugfix: Z80 sometimes 'compressed' 16K blocks into more
                than 16K, and refused to load the resulting file.  Z80 file
                format has been changed.  (Robert Zmyslowicz, Erik Kunze)
              - Bugfix: IN to page Multiface rom/ram in or out corrupted A
                register  (Genie 128; James McKay and Blood)
         (*)  - Bugfix: Z80 didn't swallow read-only VOC files, and TAP2VOC
                produced those for no reason.  (Einar Gattoni Saukas)
         (*)  - Out2Voc of v3.04 registered distribution didn't work,
                because wrong memory model was chosen.  (Wojtek Wasilewski)
         (*)  - Bugfix: playing a .VOC file and then loading a .TAP file
                caused Z80 to crash.  (Wojtek Wasilewski)
         (*)  - Bugfix: loading a +D .Z80 snapshot with no PLUSDROM.BIN
                file present now causes Z80 to select Disciple mode
                automatically, instead of printing error message and quit.
                (Robert Zmyslowicz)
              - Bugfix: Level numbers were sometimes incorrectly appended
                when forming name of .DAT file.  (Robert Zmyslowicz)
              - Bugfix: When two snapshots of the same name existed, the
                .SNA one was loaded, and never the poor .Z80 one.  (Blood)

                This finally enables reliable loading via a SoundBlaster.
         (*)  - Bugfix: Disciple snapshots don't overwrite old data anymore
              - Needs 16K less memory: fast/full/minimal (default,-xt,-xu):
                564K, 517K, 481K; uses 240K less base memory if Extended

                added.
              - The emulator returns 'No ZX Printer attached' if the output
                printer is not there or off-line; previously the emulator
                hang on a COPY with no printer to print to. Switch -xj
                added.  (Lords of Midnight, SuperSpy)
              - Added -xy trace feature

              - Bugfix: SoundBlaster is properly turned off at exit
              - Bugfix: RES/SET opcodes can't change ROM anymore (Catch23
                and Batman, the Capped Crusade; thanks to Gerardo Oporto
                Jorrin)
              - Bugfix: CTRL-ENTER when loading snapshot now also keeps
                part of hardware mode fixed.
              - Opcode for loading levels is ED FB, not ED F6 as the
                documentation said previously. (Russell Marks)
              - Bugfix: Loading snapshot saved in +D hardware mode with no
                PLUSDROM.BIN file present does not return Z80 to DOS
                anymore.

         (*)  - TAP2VOC can now produce raw sample files.
              - Bugfix: Mouse and analogue joystick work together and
                properly. (Niccolo Rigacci)
              - Improved Hi Resolution Color emulation; the emulator uses
                different timings in 128K modes, and locks in on memory
                pushes to synchronise.  Most programs that use HRC effects
                work correctly now.
              - Bugfix: Without EMS memory, Multiface 128 did not work.
              - Small error fixed and explanation added in DOC about new
                .Z80 file headers (Arnt Gulbrandsen).
              - Added: Switch to turn off Hi Resolution Color emulation

                (and low order byte), making at least one problem program
                run. (Igor 'Iggy' Eged)



3/11/94         Version 3.02 released

              - Bugfix: Without EMS memory, a Spectrum error with IF1 on

              - Fixed CTRL-BREAK bug,
              - Fixed several other bugs, and
              - a nice new intro screen.



14/8/92         Version 1.45 released.

              - Z80 emulator is now about 5% faster. Arnt Gulbrandsen,
                the author of JPP, pointed out to me that I was clearing
                the BL register too often.
              - The analogue joystick now really works
         (*)  - SAVEing programs to tape now really works (if you're a
                registered user)
              - You can now load .SNA files (commonly used snapshot format)
                directly into the emulator, without having to convert them
                with ConvZ80.
              - The Interface-I RS232 channel can now also be attached to
                COM3 and COM4.
         (*)  - ConvZ80 now also supports the .SP format used by a Spectrum
                emulator called 'SPECTRUM', written by Pedro Gimeno.
              - A capacitor in DIAGRAMS.Z80 had the wrong value (17-8-92)
              - .SNA files that were loaded were not properly closed,
                resulting in a FILE NOT FOUND error. (17-8-92)



27/7/92         Version 1.41 released. The 1.40 version of Z80.EXE was
                packed with COMPACK (sort of PKLITE), which was bugged:
                it didn't run on some '386s and '486s. This version isn't
                packed anymore.



16/7/92         Version 1.40 released, Shareware and for registered
                users.

         (*)  - Full tape support! A program DIAGRAMS.Z80 is supplied,
                that consists of two diagrams of tape-adapters for PC's,
                and a test-program useful for calibration of the
                adapters.
         (*)  - A utility to read DISCiPLE floppies.
              - The analogue IBM joystick and a special interface for
                digital (Spectrum) joysticks are supported. In the
                documentation file is a diagram for the digital joystick
                interface.
              - A more extensive manual, and a summary for English-
                speaking users.
              - Speed measurement of the Z80 emulator is more accurate.
                (V1.20 overestimated the speed.)
              - Function keys F1-F7 and F10 are now used.
              - The Emulator can run in 'Real'-mode, for better sound
                and for tape (speed-)load and save.
              - R register emulation is now perfect, so that protected
                games (e.g. lenslock games) can be loaded.
              - Video routines are faster.
              - Several bugfixes concerning writes in ROM. (Strong Man)
              - The settings of Issue 2 emulation, Double Interrupt
                frequency, Video synchronisation mode and joystick are
                stored in .Z80 files.



6/11/91         Version 1.30, for registered users only:

              - It is now much easier to choose a file from the main
                menu: the cursor keys, PgUp and PgDn can be used to
                browse through the list of files, and letter-keys make
                the bar jump to the first file that starts with that
                letter. The files are now alphabetically ordered.
              - Sinclair joystick 1 added (keys 1-5)
              - If a path is entered at the command line, the Emulator
                automatically jumps to the main menu, option 'load
                program', and changes to the specified directory.
              - If a file is attached to the RS232 in- or output
                channel, the read- or write-position is shown (main
                menu, options I and O)
              - Switches -yl and -yh are added, for Low and High video
                synchronisation. With these switches, the flickering of
                sprites of some games can be reduced. (Ghost 'n Goblins,
                Uridium)
              - Bugfix: DOS-clock ran too fast in version 1.25
              - Bugfix: On AT's the Emulator crashed if Spectrum programs
                used interrupt mode 2 while the I register was 255.
                (Full Throttle)
              - Unofficial flags are now emulated better. (Ghost'n Goblins)
         (*)  - Extra utility CONVZ80, converts .Z80 files in .SP and
                .SNA files, the snapshot formats of the Spanish Spectrum
                emulator VGASPEC and the Norwegian Spectrum emulator JPP
                respectively, and vice versa.
         (*)  - Utility Z80DUMP; displays the header of .Z80 files.



4/10/91         Version 1.25, for registered users only:

              - Bugfix of instructions CB30 to CB37 (Bounder)
              - 50 Hz interrupt and video update run 180 degrees out of
                phase (BC Quest for Tires)
              - SLA, SRA, SRL sped up.
         (*)  - Switch -z added: the Emulator now can be slowed down to
                about a factor 4.
              - Bugfix sound: some computers only produced sound after a
                OUT 31,13.
              - Switch -2 added for Issue-2 emulation (Spinads)
              - Bugfix GETRS: now reading from COM2 works, and an
                on-screen counter shows the progress.
         (*)  - CONVERT extended: GIF-files can be made directly from
                .Z80 files



30/7/91         Version 1.20 released.  Eerste, geheel Nederlandse versie.



11/11/88        First line of code written.
